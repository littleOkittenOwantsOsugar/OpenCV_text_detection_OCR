# OpenCV_text_detection_OCR - Using EasyOCR

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of text detection using OpenCV and EasyOCR. It was created as part of a beginner tutorial to learn about image processing and optical character recognition (OCR). The application detects text within images, draws bounding boxes around the detected text, and displays the recognized text.

## Features
- Detects text in images using EasyOCR
- Draws bounding boxes around detected text
- Displays recognized text on the image

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
- **OpenCV**: A library for computer vision tasks.
- **EasyOCR**: A lightweight OCR library that supports multiple languages.
